# Diamond Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. Using data analysis, visualization, and deep learning techniques, the goal is to build an accurate model for price estimation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features related to diamond characteristics, including:
- **Carat** - Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut** - Quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium, Good).
- **Color** - Diamond color grading.
- **Clarity** - Measure of internal flaws.
- **Depth & Table** - Proportions affecting diamond brilliance.
- **Price** - Target variable representing diamond price in USD.

## Objectives
The project covers the following tasks:

### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Convert categorical features (e.g., cut, color, clarity) into numerical representations.
- Normalize or scale numerical features for better model performance.

### Data Visualization
- Explore price distributions and relationships with features.
- Create scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to analyze trends.
- Use correlation heatmaps to understand feature interactions.

### Deep Learning Model (TensorFlow Neural Network)
- Implement a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Construct a neural network with multiple dense layers to predict diamond prices.
- Use activation functions such as ReLU for hidden layers and linear activation for output.
- Compile the model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
- Train the model using the dataset and validate its performance using a test set.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and RÂ² metrics.

## Results
- Comparison of traditional regression models with the deep learning model.
- Improved price prediction accuracy using a TensorFlow-based neural network.
- Insights into the most influential features affecting diamond price.
